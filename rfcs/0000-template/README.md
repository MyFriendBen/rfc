## Summary

[Provide a brief overview of the RFC. This should be 1-2 paragraphs that explain the goal of the RFC without going into deep technical details. The summary should be clear enough that someone unfamiliar with the project can understand what is being proposed.]

## Background

[Provide at least two paragraphs of background information. This section should give complete context for why this change is necessary. Include links to any prior discussions, related RFCs, or issues. The goal is to help newcomers understand the complete context without having to search through multiple documents.]

[Include information about:
- The current state of the system
- Problems or limitations with the current approach
- User feedback or requests that motivated this RFC
- Any previous attempts to solve this problem]

## Proposal

[Provide an overview of your proposed solution. This should be a high-level explanation of "how" you plan to solve the problem described in the background. Keep this section focused on the overall approach rather than implementation details.]

### Abandoned Ideas

[Optional: Explain any approaches that were considered but rejected. Include why these ideas were abandoned. This helps reviewers understand the thought process and prevents rehashing of already-explored solutions.]

## Implementation

[Provide detailed implementation information. This section should contain enough detail that someone could implement the proposal. Include:
- Technical architecture
- API changes
- Data structures
- Algorithms
- Migration strategy]
